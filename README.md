# Sunway University Project Showcase 🏫
Welcome to my Sunway University project showcase repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I completed during my time at Sunway.

## Overview 🔍
This repository serves as a portfolio of the projects I undertook during my tenure at Sunway University. Currently, it features two completed projects: Business Statistics and AI Decision Making.

## Business Statistics 📈
In this project, I utilized R Studio to conduct both individual and group assignments. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a bank loan dataset to uncover relationships between variables. Additionally, the group assignment focused on analyzing sleep efficiency, employing statistical methods to determine the factors influencing sleep efficiency.

## AI Decision Making 🤖
For this project, the focus was on testing an external company's AI face detection system. The project involved writing automation scripts in Python for software testing purposes. Selenium was the primary tool utilized for automating the testing process.
