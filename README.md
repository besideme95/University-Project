# University-R-Language---Project
Within this project, it showcase the statistical project that I have conducted on an individual and group project.

## Individual
I analyzed a dataset on bank loan approvals to figure out which factor has the most impact on the approval outcome. My goal was to pinpoint the key independent variable in this financial puzzle.

## Group
Our group chose a sleep efficiency dataset. Using a literature review, we picked the dependent variable. We then conducted statistical tests to find the significant impact of the independent variable on the chosen dependent variable.
